# IPL-2024-Analysis
As part of the CodeBasics Resume Project Challenge #10, I embarked on an exciting journey to analyze historical IPL data and provide insights on IPL 2024. This project involved creating a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI and Excel, covering various aspects of the game such as batting, bowling, team performance, and predictions. I am thrilled to share the insights I uncovered and the interactive dashboard that brings this data to life.
